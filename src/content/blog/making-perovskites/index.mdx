# First Week at the Lab

I’m writing this a while after actually having my first week, so it will be more of a summary looking back at what I’ve learned so far.

# Making Thin films!

For training, my mentor had me and another student make (CsFAPb)I samples using the techniques I will eventually have to use for my FURI project.

### Step 1: Cleaning

First, we have to clean the glass slides in a mixture of soap, acetone, then IBA. We do this by dipping the slides in the solution—then shaking them by placing the beaker into an ultra-sonic cleaner for about 5–10 minutes (which sends sonar waves through the water to shake the beaker).

<Callout variant="important">Only rub/rinse with toothbrush and DI water after using extern.</Callout>

Once the slides have been cleaned with the solution, we clean the slides off with a nitrogen spray to dry them.

After this, we place the slides (labeled-side-down) into the UV-Box to be once again dried and remove any further remains of soap or debris. (Also another 10–15 minutes)

### Step 2: Processing the Films

All of the following was completed in the glove box.

<Callout variant="warning">Make sure to follow all lab protocols and any rules set by the lab when using the glove box.</Callout>

#### 1. The Mixture

In order to get the right amount of mL, we have to compute the mixture as such:

**Recipe:** 5mL, 1.4M of Cs(0.2)FA(0.8)PbI₂

<Callout title="Calculating moles" variant="example">
  $$
  n = 1.4\, \mathrm{mol/L} \times 5\, \mathrm{mL} \ (0.005\, \mathrm{L}) = 0.007\, \mathrm{mol} = 7\, \mathrm{mmol}
  $$
</Callout>

| **Precursor** | **Ratio** | **Moles = 7mmol × Ratio** |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| CsI           | 0.2        | 1.4 mmol                  |
| FAI           | 0.8        | 5.6 mmol                  |
| PbI₂          | 1.0        | 7.0 mmol                  |

| **Compound** | **Molar Mass (g/mol)** | **Mass = moles × Molar Mass** |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| CsI          | 259.81                 | 363.73 mg                      |
| FAI          | 171.97                 | 963.03 mg                      |
| PbI₂         | 461.01                 | 3227.07 mg                     |

We must also calculate the amount of solvent needed to mix these powders together:

**Solvent Ratio:** 1(NMP) : 6.5(DMF)

<Callout title="Solvent volumes" variant="example">
  $$
  \mathrm{NMP} = \frac{1}{7.5} \times 5000\, \mu L = 667\, \mu L
  $$
  $$
  \mathrm{DMF} = \frac{6.5}{7.5} \times 5000\, \mu L = 4333\, \mu L
  $$
</Callout>

<Callout variant="note">You can also derive these values from a molar mass ratio method:</Callout>

<Callout title="Mass ratio equalities" variant="example">
  $$
  \frac{1}{259.81} = \frac{1.4}{363.734}
  $$
  $$
  \frac{1}{171.97} = \frac{5.6}{963.032}
  $$
  $$
  \frac{1}{461.01} = \frac{7}{3227.07}
  $$
</Callout>

#### 2. Mixing the Ink

Measure out your materials neatly and carefully and add powders into a glass vial/container. Syringe the solvent(s) into the vial.

Stir for a set time (15–20 mins) using a vortex mixer until powders completely dissolve and there are no major visible particles.

<Callout variant="important">Add PVP **after** mixing the solvents.</Callout>

#### 3. Spin Coating and Annealing

<Callout variant="warning">Make sure to follow all lab protocols and any rules set by the lab when using the spin coater and other instruments.</Callout>

Preheat the hot plate to necessary temperature (125°C). Also preheat your solution before spin coating if necessary.

1. Open the spin coater, and line the top cover and inner edges with tin foil or something to stop the ink from staining the machine.
    - If you’re gas quenching, then open gas valves and pumps.
    - Align nozzles above spin platform.

2. Use tweezers to place a glass slide onto the platform, and turn on the spin coater vacuum so the sample doesn’t fall while spinning.
    - Pipette 3–4 drops of solution onto the slide.

3. Run the spin coater at recommended settings (ask mentor for specific speeds).
    - If gas quenching, turn on valve to 50 psi during high speed for ~20s.

4. Once done, transfer the covered sample to the hot plate, and cook for needed time (15 mins).
    - During this part, you should see the slide go from a clear yellow to a reflective grey/black.

5. Using tweezers, take the sample off the hotplate into a safe container.
